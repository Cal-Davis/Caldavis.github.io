                <p>I was born and raised in Nairobi,Kenya.Ever since I was young , I have always loved <i> discovering new things</i>.And when I first interacted with modern technology(while I was still a child),I could not believe that such cool stuff existed; I was so captivated by the way different technologies run and operate.I soon came to learn about programming and coding while I was in High school and as curious as usual I decided to get to know what it entails and since that day, my love for programming is still as strong as ever.</p>
